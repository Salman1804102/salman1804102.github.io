<p align="justify">
Greetings! I'm Salman Farsi, a <b>competitive programmer</b> and <b>natural language processing enthusiast</b>. I have completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET), where I graduated with a CGPA of 3.80/4.0. I am greatly interested about machine learning and its practical applications in the real world. Specially uncovering the textual meaning within social media data and exploring the context of multimodal data (i.e. linguistic, acoustic, visual) in natural language processing (NLP) are focus of my interest. My research experience has been enriched by my time as a Research Intern at the CUET NLP Lab, under the mentorship of Prof. Dr. Moshiul Hoque. During this period, I had the opportunity to work on cutting-edge NLP projects, resulting in the publication of three conference papers. My work has primarily focused on exploring the intricacies of language models, stance detection, and sentiment analysis, contributing valuable insights to the academic community. Recently, I've embarked on an exciting journey to master the concept of generative AI, and I can't wait to explore its transformative potential!

Apart from that, I immersed myself in problem-solving and honed my competitive programming skills during my undergraduate times. I solved <a href = "https://www.stopstalk.com/user/profile/woolgatherer">1500+ problems</a> in different online judges and participated in numerous onsite and online programming contests. As a result, I've cultivated a strong foundation in various algorithms and data structures. In addition to my academic pursuits, I've undertaken <a href = "https://github.com/Salman1804102?tab=repositories">projects</a> related to my coursework, allowing me to gain exposure to industry-level languages and technologies. My primary expertise lies in programming languages such as C++ and Python. My commitment to excellence is reflected in my consistently strong academic performance, underscoring my solid grasp of core computer science concepts like OOP, DBMS, OS etc. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
Beyond my academic pursuits, I've had the privilege of serving as the Vice President of the <a href = "https://m.facebook.com/people/Greater-Noakhali-Students-Forum-CUET/100083839316528/">Greater Noakhali Student Forum C.U.E.T (GNSF)</a>, where I was responsible to various regional student welfare activities. I also served as Joint Programming Secretary in <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/cuetcomputerclub/">C.U.E.T Computer Club</a>. There, I took several data structure and algorithm sessions for my fellow junior coders. These experiences have honed my leadership and mentoring skills, showcasing my commitment to fostering community engagement and knowledge sharing.
